### Hi there, 👋

I'm an architect 🏗️ and ML/Computer Vision enigneer 🧑‍💻 who is very interesting in applying AI in the bulit environment/heritage, and thus create value from diff types of data (e.g., images, point clouds, etc.).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on "detecting physical damage on cultural heritage buildings images"
- 🌱 I’m currently learning "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)" to process pointcloud data with them.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on using CNNs & GNNs on built environment data.
